# Business SQL Insights Copilot

Smart AI assistant to get insights from the DB.

Our project is an **AI-powered Business Insights Copilot** that connects directly to a live SQL Server database and allows users to ask natural‑language questions about the business—no SQL knowledge required.

Using **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** through **Google AI Studio**, the system interprets user queries, generates accurate SQL, executes it on the database, and transforms the results into clear insights and visualisations.

## Key Features

- **Automated overview dashboard** showing revenue, orders, customers, and top stock groups  
- **Conversational AI copilot** that answers business questions using Gemini‑generated SQL  
- **Automatic charts and tables** for every query result  
- **Schema Explorer** that shows tables and their relationships for better understanding of the data model  

## Technology Stack

- **Streamlit** for the interactive UI  
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API** for natural‑language interpretation and SQL generation  
- **SQL Server (WideWorldImporters)** as the live transactional database  

Built with Streamlit and Gemini’s API, the solution turns raw SQL data into an interactive, intelligent, analyst‑friendly platform—ideal for business stakeholders who want fast insights without technical barriers.
