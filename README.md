Smart AI assistant to get insights from the DB


Our project is an AI-powered Business Insights Copilot that connects directly to a live SQL Server database and allows users to ask natural-language questions about the business—no SQL knowledge required. Using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash through Google AI Studio, the system interprets user queries, generates accurate SQL, executes it on the database, and transforms the results into clear insights and visualisations.

The application provides a full analytics experience:
	•	An automated overview dashboard (revenue, orders, customers, top stock groups).
	•	A conversational copilot that answers business questions using Gemini-generated SQL.
	•	Automatic charts and tables for every query result.
	•	A dedicated Schema Explorer showing tables and relationships so users understand the data model.

Built with Streamlit and Gemini’s API, the solution turns raw SQL data into an interactive, intelligent, analyst-friendly platform—ideal for business stakeholders who want fast insights without technical barriers.
